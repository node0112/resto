Rendering a whole webpage using JS &amp; Webpack

This project quite a while as webpack ins't easy to learn at first but it gets easier.

A REALLY HELPFUL TIP:
Create your website as you would normally without webpack and save the css file in your source folder and save the index file somewhere so that you can use it as a reference while making your divs using webpack!
